        <h1>Survey Instruction</h1>
        <p>Please read the following instruction carefully.<br><br>
            On your desk, you'll find a folder containing a $5 coupon. During the upcoming survey, you'll be presented
            with a randomly selected mobile app and asked whether you currently use it. If yes, you'll be asked to
            evaluate 5 shortlisted features for the app's upcoming update. <strong>Choose the feature you would most
                like
                to use and specify how much you'd pay for
                using it
                using the $5 coupon </strong>(payment options range from 0 to 5).
            <br>
            <br>
            Upon completing the survey and exiting the room, a staff member will redeem the coupon. Among all the
            products you assessed, one already has a beta version. We will provide you with credentials to access the
            features you selected in the survey. <strong><u>Your
                    indicated
                    payment will be deducted from the coupon.</u></strong> The staff will hand you the remaining amount
            in cash.
